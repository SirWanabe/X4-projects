# Reduced ROR-COH Jobs
This simple mod (of a mod) slightly reduces the quantity of ships of the Ossian Raiders faction. Requires the mod Raise of the Ossian Raiders by SCO81 to do anything. 
The goal of the mod is to get some frame rate back for older computers without compromising the Apocalyptic nature of Ossian Raiders by too much.

This version changes over some of the ships "added" by Reduced ROR Jobs to Terrans and also slightly further reduces the quantity of Ossian Raider ships, justified by their ships generally being slightly more powerful.
