# Reduced DeadairJobs
This simple mod (of a mod) reduces the overall fleet quantities in order to improve performance for computers which are slower than the intended specs for the original DeadAirJobs mod.
Only use this if your FPS is too low when using DeadAirJobs.

Slight reduction to total economy ships, which is still far higher than vanilla X4 balancing.
Larger reduction to quantity of L/X ships and their escorts have been changed around a bit. L fleets have smaller subordinate counts but XL fleets have larger.
